        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2 style="color: #1877f2; margin-top: 0;">Event Scraper & Social Media Monitor</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Event Scraper & Social Media Monitor ("we", "our", "the App", or "the Application") is a web-based 
            application designed to aggregate, analyze, and monitor public social media content for event detection, 
            news monitoring, and information aggregation purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy describes how we access, use, and protect information obtained through our application, 
            particularly in relation to our use of the Facebook Platform and other social media platforms.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>
        <p>Our application accesses the following types of <strong>publicly available information</strong> from social media platforms:</p>

        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We ONLY access content that is already publicly visible to anyone on the internet. 
            We do not access private messages, private posts, or content that requires login to view.
        </div>
        
        <h2>3. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>

            <li>Email addresses or phone numbers (except our contact email for support)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Information accessed from public social media posts is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event Detection:</strong> Identifying and categorizing events (accidents, protests, disasters, etc.) from public posts</li>
            <li><strong>News Aggregation:</strong> Collecting and organizing news and information from public sources</li>
            <li><strong>Content Display:</strong> Presenting public content to authorized users of our application</li>

            <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Identifying patterns and trends in public discourse about events</li>
            <li><strong>Search and Discovery:</strong> Enabling users to search across multiple social media platforms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>Our data handling practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temporary Caching:</strong> Public content is cached in-memory for performance optimization (maximum 24 hours)</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Deletion:</strong> All cached content is automatically deleted after 24 hours</li>
            <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> We do not store social media content in permanent databases</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated Events:</strong> Extracted event information (structured data like date, location, type) may be stored for search functionality</li>
            <li><strong>No User Profiles:</strong> We do not create or maintain user profiles based on social media data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We have strict policies regarding data sharing:</p>
        
        <h3>We DO NOT:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell, rent, or trade any data</li>
            <li>Share data with third-party marketers or advertisers</li>
            <li>Use data for targeted advertising</li>
            <li>Transfer data to third parties for their own use</li>
            <li>Provide data to data brokers or analytics companies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>We MAY share data only in these limited circumstances:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or government regulation</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With service providers who help operate our application (e.g., hosting), under strict confidentiality agreements</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfer:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (with notification to users)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Facebook Platform Compliance</h2>
        <p>Our application complies with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facebook Platform Terms of Service</li>
            <li>Facebook Platform Policy</li>
            <li>Meta's Data Use Policies</li>
            <li>Graph API Terms and Conditions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            We use the Facebook Graph API with <strong>Page Public Content Access</strong> permission to access 
            only public posts from public Facebook Pages. This is content that is already visible to anyone on the 
            internet and does not require any special permissions to view on Facebook itself.
        </p>
        
        <h2>8. User Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>
            Since we only access publicly available information that you (or Page administrators) have already made 
            public on social media platforms, we do not maintain personal user data. However, we respect your rights:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can contact us to inquire about any cached data related to specific content</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of specific cached content (which auto-deletes within 24 hours anyway)</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> If you find inaccurate information, please contact us for correction</li>
            <li><strong>Source Control:</strong> To remove content from our application, remove it from the source platform (Facebook, YouTube, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure API communication using HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
            <li>Access tokens stored securely as environment variables</li>
            <li>Access controls limiting who can use the application</li>
            <li>Regular security updates and patches</li>
            <li>In-memory caching (not persistent storage) for temporary data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from 
            children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently accessed content from children under 13, 
            we will take steps to delete such information promptly.
        </p>
        
        <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Our application may access public content from users and Pages located in various countries. Public social 
            media content is inherently international in nature. By making content public on social media platforms, 
            users and Page administrators acknowledge that their content is accessible worldwide.
        </p>
        
        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, 
            legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
            <li>We will post the revised policy on this page</li>
            <li>For material changes, we may provide additional notice (email notification or prominent notice on our application)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting information.
        </p>
        
        <h2>13. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR/CCPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>Our legal basis for processing public information includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> We have a legitimate interest in news aggregation, event monitoring, and public information dissemination</li>
            <li><strong>Public Information:</strong> We process information that has been manifestly made public by the data subject or Page administrator</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> We process data in compliance with platform terms of service and applicable laws</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>14. Your California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right to know what personal information is collected</li>
            <li>Right to know whether personal information is sold or disclosed</li>
            <li>Right to access personal information</li>
            <li>Right to request deletion of personal information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, please note that we primarily access public information that is not considered "personal information" 
            under most privacy laws, as it has been made publicly accessible by the original poster.
        </p>
